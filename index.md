# Mele Manoa

## Overview
Mele Manoa is a web application designed to bring musicians of UH together for jam sessions or performing bands. It is an easy way for them to find others with similar tastes and compatible musical abilities, by allowing students to create a profile indicating their musical tastes, their musical capabilities, and their musical goals.

## User Guide
Login with your UH username and create your profile. Your profile will include your musical talents and interests, and will be made public for others to see so that you will be able to join groups for jam sessions. Navigate to the 'Discover' page to find others of similar musical interests as yours.
Admin accounts will be able to create more options for instrument groups and genres that the Discover page can be filtered by.
